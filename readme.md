# CRTS

What is CT or Certificate Transparency? Certificate Transparency (CT) is a public and open system that was introduced by Google to monitor and audit SSL/TLS certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs). The idea behind CT is to make the certificate issuance process more transparent and accessible, to avoid problems such as the issuance of fraudulent certificates.
